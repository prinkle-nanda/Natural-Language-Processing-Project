# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning. It focuses on analyzing stock market news sentiment and summarizing key insights to predict stock price movements using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project applies text preprocessing, word embeddings, and sentiment analysis to understand the impact of news on stock trends.

# Key Objectives
  * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on stock market news.
  * Preprocess text data:
     - Tokenization, stopword removal and stemming.
     - Removing special characters and handling missing values.
  * Implement word embeddings using:
     - Gensim Word2Vec
     - GloVe
     - Sentence Transformers
  * Apply sentiment analysis to classify news polarity.
  * Train models to predict stock price movements based on sentiment.
  * Summarize news articles using NLP techniques

# Tools & Libraries Used
  * Python (Jupyter Notebook)
  * NLTK (Text Preprocessing & Tokenization)
  * Gensim (Word2Vec Embeddings)
  * Sentence Transformers 
  * Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)
  * Transformers (Hugging Face for NLP)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

# Analysis Performed
  * Data Preprocessing
     - Cleaning text data (stopwords, punctuation)
     - Removing HTML tags, special characters, and unnecessary whitespace
  * Word Embeddings & Feature Extraction
     - Word2Vec embeddings using Gensim
     - Sentence embeddings
  * Sentiment Analysis
     - Assigning sentiment scores to news articles
     - Using rule-based and machine-learning-based sentiment classifiers
  * Stock Price Movement Prediction
     - Training classification models (Random Forest)
     - Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
  * News Summarization
     - Using NLP models to extract key insights from financial news
